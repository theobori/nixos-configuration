# Customization

My Nix configuration, based on the [SnowfallOrg lib](https://github.com/snowfallorg/lib) structure, provides a
flexible and organized approach to managing your Nix environment. Here's how it
works:

- **Custom Library**: An optional custom library in the `lib/` directory
  contains a Nix function called with `inputs`, `snowfall-inputs`, and `lib`.
  The function should return an attribute set to merge with `lib`.

- **Modular Directory Structure**: You can create any (nestable) directory
  structure within `lib/`, `packages/`, `modules/`, `overlays/`, `systems/`, and
  `homes/`. Each directory should contain a Nix function that returns an
  attribute set to merge with the corresponding section.

- **Package Overlays**: The `packages/` directory includes an optional set of
  packages to export. Each package is instantiated with `callPackage`, and the
  files should contain functions that take an attribute set of packages and the
  required `lib` to return a derivation.

- **Modules for Configuration**: In the `modules/` directory, you can define
  NixOS modules for various platforms, such as `nixos`, `darwin`, and `home`.
  This modular approach simplifies system configuration management.

- **Custom Overlays**: The `overlays/` directory is for optional custom
  overlays. Each overlay file should contain a function that takes three
  arguments: an attribute set of your flake's inputs and a `channels` attribute
  containing all available channels, the final set of `pkgs`, and the previous
  set of `pkgs`. This allows you to customize package sets effectively.

- **System Configurations**: The `systems/` directory organizes system
  configurations based on architecture and format. You can create configurations
  for different architectures and formats, such as `x86_64-linux`,
  `aarch64-darwin`, and more.

- **Home Configurations**: Similar to system configurations, the `homes/`
  directory organizes home configurations based on architecture and format. This
  is especially useful if you want to manage home environments with Nix.

This structured approach to Nix configuration makes it easier to manage and
customize your Nix environment while maintaining flexibility and modularity.
